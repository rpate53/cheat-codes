        \begin{itemize}
            \item Learn how Uber makes money and how much

            delivery business

            strategy?
            \item What are the key inputs for Uber's pricing 
            and payout algorithms that determine how much 
            it charges a customer and how much it pays the 
            delivery driver and restaurant?
        \end{itemize}
        \item If public, look at earnings reports/note business metrics
        \item If private, look at comparable companies.
        \item Google search "company name business model"
        \item Look at Company's Engineering Blog
        \item Use the product!! Smaller companies will test you.
        \item Useful in asking interviewer questions at the end. i.e. 
        "I was reading about the food delivery time estimation algorithm 
        on the blog and found X fascinating. I was curious why you used 
        approach Y, and if you ever thought about trying out Z instead?"
